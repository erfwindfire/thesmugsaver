</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The government will give you £2,000 per child per year in free money — and most eligible parents have no idea it exists.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">That's not an exaggeration. Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) is one of the most underused government schemes in the UK. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tax-free-childcare-statistics" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC's own statistics</a> show that millions of eligible families aren't claiming it, collectively leaving hundreds of millions of pounds on the table every year. If you're paying for nursery, after-school clubs, holiday camps or a registered childminder, and your child is under 12, there is a very good chance you're owed money right now.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The reason so few people use it? It was introduced quietly in 2017, explained badly, and given a name that makes it sound like it only applies to basic-rate taxpayers. It doesn't. It's available to most working parents — including higher earners, self-employed parents and couples where one partner is on parental leave. Here's everything you need to know.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. How It Works: The 25% Bonus Nobody Told You About</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare runs through an online account that works like a matched-savings pot for childcare costs. You pay money in, the government automatically adds 25% on top, and you use the total balance to pay your registered childcare provider directly.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In practice: put in £800, the government adds £200. Put in £2,000 in a quarter, the government adds £500. Do that across a full year and you receive £2,000 of free money — just for using the account to pay bills you'd have been paying anyway. The rate is equivalent to basic-rate tax relief, which is why the scheme is called "Tax-Free" — it's compensating you for childcare costs paid from already-taxed income.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The maths is simple: for every £8 you deposit, the government contributes £2. That is a guaranteed 25% return, better than any cash ISA or savings account currently available. There is no investment risk, no lock-in period and no catch — you just have to remember to use it. For more on maximising returns on your money, see our <a href="/savings-and-investing/best-high-yield-savings-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to the best high-yield savings accounts in 2026</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For children with disabilities or special educational needs, the limits double. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK guidance</a>, you can deposit up to £16,000 per year and receive up to £4,000 from the government for a disabled child. The scheme also runs until the child's 17th birthday rather than the standard age of 12.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Who Qualifies</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The eligibility rules are simpler than most government schemes like to make them sound. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC's official guidance</a>, you qualify if all of the following apply:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li>You are employed or self-employed — and both parents must be working (or it's a lone-parent household with the parent working)</li>
<li>Each of you earns at least £8,670 per year — that's the equivalent of 16 hours a week at National Minimum Wage</li>
<li>Neither of you individually earns more than £100,000 per year</li>
<li>Your child is under 12 years old (or under 17 if they have a disability or special educational need)</li>
<li>Your child uses Ofsted-registered or government-approved childcare</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Self-employed parents qualify even if their income is irregular, as long as they expect to earn at least £8,670 across the coming quarter. Maternity leave, paternity leave and sick leave don't disqualify you — the "working" requirement is about your employment status, not whether your pay is arriving that particular week. If you're navigating an irregular income, our <a href="/budgeting/flexible-budgets-irregular-income-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to budgeting on a variable income</a> has practical strategies that pair well with TFC.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If one parent doesn't work and the other earns over £100,000, you don't qualify. If both parents work but one earns below £8,670, you also don't qualify — both need to clear the minimum. Beyond those cases, the scheme is broader than most people assume.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. What Childcare It Covers</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The scheme covers any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-ofsted-inspection-report" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ofsted-registered</a> or government-approved childcare provider in England — and equivalent registered providers in Scotland (Care Inspectorate), Wales (Care Inspectorate Wales) and Northern Ireland (Health and Social Care Trust). In practical terms, that includes:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li>Nurseries and day nurseries</li>
<li>Registered childminders</li>
<li>After-school clubs and breakfast clubs</li>
<li>Holiday clubs and play schemes (must be registered)</li>
<li>Nannies placed through a registered nanny agency (the agency, not the nanny individually, must be registered)</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">One important point: your provider must be signed up to accept Tax-Free Childcare payments before you can pay them through the account. Most mainstream nurseries, chains and childminders are already registered. If yours isn't, ask them to sign up at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childcare-providers-and-the-tax-free-childcare-scheme" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's provider portal</a> — it takes around 20 minutes and costs them nothing. Most are happy to do it once they understand there's no downside.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Childcare costs in the UK have risen sharply in recent years. According to the <a href="https://familyandchildcaretrust.org" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family and Childcare Trust's 2025 Childcare Survey</a>, average nursery fees now exceed £14,800 per year nationally — making the TFC top-up worth more than ever in real terms. For a full breakdown of what childcare actually costs by type and region, see our <a href="/family-and-lifestyle/childcare-costs-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">complete guide to UK childcare costs in 2026</a>.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. How to Apply</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The application is at <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">childcarechoices.gov.uk</a> and takes around 20 minutes. You'll need your National Insurance number, your partner's details, your child's date of birth, and a rough estimate of your income for the next three months.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Step by Step</h3>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li><strong>Check your eligibility</strong> first using the <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Childcare Choices calculator</a> — it takes five minutes and shows you every scheme you're eligible for, not just TFC</li>
<li><strong>Create an account</strong> using your Government Gateway login (the same one you use for Self Assessment or your personal tax account)</li>
<li><strong>Complete the eligibility check</strong> — you'll answer questions about employment, income and your child's care arrangements</li>
<li><strong>Receive your childcare account</strong> — if approved, you get an 11-digit eligibility code to give to your provider</li>
<li><strong>Deposit money</strong> — transfer funds in via bank transfer or debit card; the government top-up appears automatically within a few days</li>
<li><strong>Pay your provider</strong> — transfer the balance directly to their registered account</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The most important thing to remember after you're approved: you must reconfirm your eligibility every three months. HMRC sends a reminder email, and the process takes around two minutes. Miss the window and your account is temporarily suspended — you can reactivate it by reconfirming, but you'll lose access and won't be able to pay providers in the meantime. Put a recurring diary reminder in your calendar from day one.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">5. Tax-Free Childcare vs Universal Credit and Tax Credits</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This is the decision that matters most for lower-income families. Tax-Free Childcare and the childcare element of Universal Credit are <strong>not compatible</strong> — you cannot claim both simultaneously. You have to choose.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-childcare-costs" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Credit childcare support</a> covers up to 85% of eligible childcare costs (up to a maximum of £1,014.63 per month for one child or £1,739.37 for two or more children as of 2026), which is substantially more generous than TFC's 25% top-up for most lower-income families. If you're currently on Universal Credit and spending meaningful amounts on childcare, UC support will almost certainly be worth considerably more.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare makes more financial sense for families above the Universal Credit threshold — typically those on middle to higher incomes paying large childcare bills who don't otherwise receive means-tested benefits. If you're unsure where you stand on benefits, our <a href="/cost-of-living/cost-of-living-payment-2026-dwp-support" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to DWP support payments in 2026</a> covers the full landscape of government financial help.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The same incompatibility applies to Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. If you're currently claiming either, switching to TFC means giving up your existing entitlement — and for many families, those credits are worth considerably more than the TFC top-up. Always calculate the value of both options before switching.

<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Crucially, Tax-Free Childcare <em>is</em> fully compatible with your free funded childcare hours. Use your 15 or 30 funded hours first, then run any additional hours or all holiday care through your TFC account for the bonus top-up. Stacking both is where the savings really compound.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">6. How to Get the Most Out of It</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Use it for holiday clubs — this is where it pays off most.</strong> Summer holiday childcare can cost £150–£500 per week per child. Running that through your TFC account automatically saves 25%. One child in holiday clubs for six weeks could save you £200–£450 with zero extra effort. For ways to cut holiday costs beyond childcare, see our <a href="/family-and-lifestyle/travel-deals-cheap-holidays-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to cheap family holidays in 2026</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Automate it with a standing order.</strong> The most common reason families don't maximise TFC is forgetting to deposit money regularly. Set up a standing order from your current account so funds flow in automatically each month — the top-up then appears without you having to remember anything. Our <a href="/budgeting/automate-savings-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to automating your savings</a> has more on how to build this kind of friction-free financial habit.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Plan around the quarterly top-up cap.</strong> The government's £500 quarterly top-up resets at the start of each quarter (roughly January, April, July and October). If you hit the cap before the quarter ends, further deposits in that period won't receive the bonus. Plan larger one-off payments — like a holiday club booking — for the start of a fresh quarter rather than the end of an old one.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Open separate accounts for each child.</strong> Each eligible child gets their own TFC account with its own £2,000 annual cap. A family with two children both in paid childcare can receive up to £4,000 per year from the government — simply by routing payments through the accounts rather than paying providers directly from your bank.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Combine with salary sacrifice schemes if available.</strong> Some employers offer childcare salary sacrifice arrangements (separate from the old Childcare Voucher scheme, which is closed to new entrants). If yours does, take advice on whether combining this with TFC is permitted and beneficial — it depends on your specific employer scheme rules.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">7. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li><strong>Not checking your provider is registered.</strong> Confirm they accept TFC payments before you apply. If they're not signed up, ask them to register at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childcare-providers-and-the-tax-free-childcare-scheme" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK provider portal</a> — it costs them nothing and takes 20 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the three-month reconfirmation.</strong> Diary the dates the moment your account is approved. A missed window suspends access and means you can't pay providers from the account until you reactivate it.</li>
<li><strong>Claiming TFC while on Universal Credit or Tax Credits.</strong> This triggers an overpayment you'll need to repay. Check your existing entitlements carefully — and contact the relevant benefit office before applying.</li>
<li><strong>Assuming the £100,000 cap is per household.</strong> The upper income limit is £100,000 per individual parent, not combined. A couple where both earn £95,000 still qualifies. Many higher-earning families assume they're excluded when they're not.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the scheme covers school-age children.</strong> TFC isn't just for nursery. After-school clubs, breakfast clubs and holiday camps all count, right up until your child's 12th birthday. Many parents stop thinking about TFC once their child starts school and miss out for years.</li>
<li><strong>Not using the Childcare Choices calculator first.</strong> The <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government's calculator</a> shows every scheme you're eligible for — TFC, free hours, Universal Credit childcare — side by side. Running the numbers before you apply ensures you pick the most valuable option for your household.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">1. Can I use Tax-Free Childcare if I'm self-employed with irregular income?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes. Self-employed parents qualify as long as you expect to earn at least £8,670 over the next three months (pro-rated from the annual minimum). HMRC uses a projected earnings figure rather than demanding proof upfront — you simply confirm what you expect to earn. If your income varies month to month, as is common for freelancers and contractors, you can still apply based on a reasonable forward projection. If your income later falls short of what you projected, you may be asked to repay some of the top-up, so keep records of your income expectations and why they were reasonable at the time. HMRC's guidance for self-employed parents is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">2. What happens to my Tax-Free Childcare account if I go on maternity or paternity leave?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">You can keep claiming Tax-Free Childcare during maternity, paternity, shared parental or adoption leave — even if your pay drops below the £8,670 minimum threshold while you're off. The grace period lasts until the end of the pay period in which your leave ends. When you return to work and your pay normalises, you continue as before. This is genuinely one of the better-designed aspects of the scheme. It doesn't penalise you for taking legitimate leave, and it means your existing child's childcare can still be paid through the account while you're at home with a new baby.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">3. My partner doesn't work. Can I still claim?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Only if you are a single parent or a lone carer, in which case only one working parent needs to meet the criteria. If you're in a couple and one partner doesn't work (and isn't on maternity, paternity or sick leave), the household doesn't qualify. Both partners in a couple need to be working and each earning at least £8,670. This is one of the scheme's genuine limitations — it excludes families where one parent has stepped back from work specifically to manage childcare, which is a particular frustration for many households with high childcare costs.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">4. What happens if my salary goes above £100,000 during the year?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If your adjusted net income rises above £100,000 at any point in the tax year, you stop being eligible. You'll need to close your TFC account, and any top-up you've already received for that quarter is not clawed back — but you won't receive any further top-ups. HMRC defines "adjusted net income" as gross income minus personal pension contributions and Gift Aid donations, so making pension contributions above £100,000 could bring you back under the threshold and restore eligibility. If your income regularly hovers near the £100,000 mark, this is worth discussing with a tax adviser. You can read more about managing income at this level in our <a href="/earning-and-benefits/tax-free-side-hustles-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">guide to tax-free earnings in 2026</a>.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">5. Can I use Tax-Free Childcare alongside the 30 free childcare hours for my 3-year-old?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes — and this combination is one of the most powerful savings stacks available to working parents. The 30 hours of free term-time childcare (for eligible working parents of 3 and 4 year olds) and Tax-Free Childcare are fully compatible. Use your funded hours to cover your nursery's term-time sessions, then use your TFC account to pay for any additional hours, wraparound care, or holiday clubs on top. From September 2026, the free hours expansion means working parents of children from 9 months old become eligible for 30 funded hours, which significantly increases the number of families who can layer TFC on top. For a full explanation of what's changing, see our <a href="/family-and-lifestyle/childcare-costs-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">childcare costs guide</a>.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">6. Can I use Tax-Free Childcare to pay a nanny or au pair?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">It depends. You can use TFC to pay a nanny — but only if the nanny is employed through a nanny agency that is itself registered with Ofsted (or the equivalent body in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland). The individual nanny does not need to be Ofsted-registered, but the agency placing them does. An au pair, in most cases, does not qualify — because au pairs are typically classified as cultural exchange visitors rather than professional childcarers, and the arrangement usually doesn't meet the registration criteria. If you employ a nanny directly (not through an agency), they would need to be individually registered with Ofsted as a childminder, which is rare. If you're unsure about your specific arrangement, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC's guidance</a> sets out the full registration requirements.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">7. Does claiming Tax-Free Childcare affect my Child Benefit?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No. Tax-Free Childcare and Child Benefit are completely independent and do not affect each other. You can claim both simultaneously without any reduction in either. Child Benefit is assessed on individual parental income (the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to anyone in the household earning over £60,000), whereas TFC is assessed on whether both parents are working and their individual incomes fall within the eligible range. If you have children under 12 and you're both working within the income thresholds, there is no reason not to claim both. For a full breakdown of Child Benefit thresholds and how the 2025 Budget changed the rules, see our <a href="/earning-and-benefits/uk-budget-2026-rachel-reeves-autumn-statement" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">UK Budget 2026 summary</a>.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">8. What happens to money left in my Tax-Free Childcare account if I stop using it?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Money in your TFC account doesn't expire and isn't automatically lost if you stop depositing. It sits in the account and remains available for future childcare payments. However, if your account becomes inactive for a long period — typically around two years without any transactions — the government may close it and return the balance to you, minus any top-up that was added. If you close the account voluntarily, you keep the money you deposited but must return any government top-up that hasn't been spent on registered childcare. The key point is not to leave significant sums in the account unused for extended periods — use it as a flow-through payment method rather than a long-term savings pot.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">9. My childcare provider refuses to sign up for Tax-Free Childcare. What can I do?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This is frustrating but not uncommon, particularly with smaller, independent childminders who are unfamiliar with the process. Start by explaining to your provider that registration is free and takes around 20 minutes via <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childcare-providers-and-the-tax-free-childcare-scheme" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's provider registration portal</a>. Emphasise that it makes payment easier for them and costs them nothing. If they still refuse, you can report your concerns to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMRC childcare helpline (0300 123 4097)</a>, though enforcement options are limited. In practice, if a provider continues to refuse and the TFC benefit is significant, it may be worth factoring this into your choice of childcare. For help thinking through the cost implications, our <a href="/family-and-lifestyle/childcare-costs-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">childcare costs comparison guide</a> walks through how to evaluate nursery vs childminder on a cost-per-hour basis.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">10. Does Tax-Free Childcare work the same way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The TFC account, eligibility rules and top-up rates are the same across all four nations — it's a UK-wide scheme administered by HMRC. What differs is the registration body your childcare provider must be signed up with. In England, providers register with Ofsted. In Scotland, they register with the Care Inspectorate. In Wales, the Care Inspectorate Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Health and Social Care Trust. The free funded childcare hours, however, vary significantly by nation — Scotland offers 1,140 funded hours annually (almost double England's term-time provision), Wales has the Flying Start programme for targeted areas, and Northern Ireland has its own separate arrangements. <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/family-and-care/becoming-a-parent/tax-free-childcare" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoneyHelper's Tax-Free Childcare guide</a> has nation-specific details if you're in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and want to understand the local picture alongside TFC.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare isn't complicated. You open an account, pay into it, the government adds 25%, and you use it to pay your childcare provider. The application takes 20 minutes. The ongoing admin is reconfirming your eligibility every three months.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For eligible families spending £5,000 or more a year on childcare — which describes a huge number of UK parents — the scheme is worth £1,000 to £2,000 every single year just for changing how you pay. Stack it with free funded hours and you could be saving several thousand pounds annually. The money is already there, waiting. The only thing required is claiming it.</p>
