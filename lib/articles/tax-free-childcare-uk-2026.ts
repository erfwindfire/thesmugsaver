</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The government will give you £2,000 per child per year in free money — and most eligible parents have no idea it exists.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">That's not an exaggeration. Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) is one of the most underused government schemes in the UK. HMRC estimates that millions of eligible families aren't claiming it, collectively leaving hundreds of millions of pounds on the table every year. If you're paying for nursery, after-school clubs, holiday camps or a registered childminder, and your child is under 12, there is a very good chance you're owed money right now.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The reason so few people use it? It was introduced quietly, explained badly, and given a name that makes it sound like it only applies to basic-rate taxpayers. It doesn't. It's available to most working parents — including higher earners, self-employed parents and couples where one partner is on parental leave. Here's everything you need to know.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. How It Works: The 25% Bonus Nobody Told You About</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare runs through an online account that works like a matched-savings pot. You pay money in, the government automatically adds 25% on top, and you use the total balance to pay your childcare provider directly.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In practice: put in £800, the government adds £200. Put in £2,000 in a quarter, the government adds £500. Do that across a full year and you receive £2,000 of free money — just for using the account to pay bills you'd have been paying anyway.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The maths is simple. For every £8 you deposit, the government contributes £2. That's a guaranteed 25% return, which beats every cash ISA and savings account currently available. There is no investment risk, no lock-in period and no catch — you just have to remember to use it.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For children with disabilities or special educational needs, the limits double. You can deposit up to £16,000 per year and receive up to £4,000 from the government. The scheme also runs until the child's 17th birthday rather than the standard age of 12.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Who Qualifies</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The eligibility rules are simpler than most government schemes like to make them sound. You qualify if all of the following are true:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li>You are employed or self-employed — and both parents must be working (or it's a lone-parent household with the parent working)</li>
<li>Each of you earns at least £8,670 per year — that's the equivalent of 16 hours a week at National Minimum Wage</li>
<li>Neither of you individually earns more than £100,000 per year</li>
<li>Your child is under 12 years old (or under 17 if they have a disability or special educational need)</li>
<li>Your child uses registered childcare — nursery, childminder, after-school club, holiday club or registered nanny agency</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Self-employed parents qualify even if their income is irregular, as long as they expect to earn at least £8,670 across the coming quarter. Maternity leave, paternity leave and sick leave don't disqualify you — the "working" requirement is about your status, not whether your pay is arriving that particular week.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If one parent doesn't work and the other earns over £100,000, you don't qualify. If both parents work but one earns below £8,670, you also don't qualify — both need to clear the minimum. Beyond those cases, the scheme is broader than most people assume.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. What Childcare It Covers</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The scheme covers any Ofsted-registered or government-approved childcare provider in England — and equivalent registered providers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In practical terms, that includes:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li>Nurseries and day nurseries</li>
<li>Registered childminders</li>
<li>After-school clubs and breakfast clubs</li>
<li>Holiday clubs and play schemes (must be registered)</li>
<li>Nannies placed through a registered nanny agency</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">One important point: your provider must be signed up to accept Tax-Free Childcare payments before you can pay them through the account. Most mainstream providers are already registered. If yours isn't, ask them to sign up — it takes around 20 minutes and costs them nothing. Most are happy to do it once they realise it costs them nothing and makes payment easier.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. How to Apply</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The application is at <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">childcarechoices.gov.uk</a> and takes around 20 minutes. You'll need your National Insurance number, your partner's details, your child's date of birth, and a rough estimate of your income for the next three months.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Step by Step</h3>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li><strong>Create an account</strong> on childcarechoices.gov.uk using your Government Gateway login (the same one you'd use for Self Assessment or HMRC)</li>
<li><strong>Complete the eligibility check</strong> — you'll answer questions about your employment, income and your child's age and care arrangements</li>
<li><strong>Receive your childcare account</strong> — if approved, you get an 11-digit code that you give to your provider</li>
<li><strong>Deposit money</strong> — transfer funds in via bank transfer or debit card; the government top-up arrives automatically within a few days</li>
<li><strong>Pay your provider</strong> — transfer the balance directly from your account to their registered account</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The most important thing to remember after you're set up: you must reconfirm your eligibility every three months. HMRC sends a reminder, and the reconfirmation takes about two minutes — you're just confirming your circumstances haven't changed. Miss the window and your account is temporarily suspended. You can reactivate it by reconfirming, but you'll lose access during the gap.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">5. Tax-Free Childcare vs Universal Credit and Tax Credits</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This is the decision that matters most for lower-income families. Tax-Free Childcare and the childcare element of Universal Credit are <strong>not compatible</strong> — you cannot claim both. You have to pick one.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Universal Credit childcare support covers up to 85% of eligible childcare costs (up to set monthly limits), which is substantially more generous than the 25% that TFC offers. If you're currently on Universal Credit and spending more than a few thousand pounds a year on childcare, UC support will almost certainly be worth more.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare makes more sense for families above the Universal Credit threshold — typically those on middle to higher incomes paying large childcare bills who don't otherwise receive means-tested support.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The same applies to Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. If you're currently claiming either, switching to TFC means giving up your existing entitlement. For many families, those tax credits are worth considerably more than the TFC top-up. Don't switch without calculating both figures first — or <a href="/earning-and-benefits/employer-ni-changes-uk-2026" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900">read our guide on benefits and earnings</a> for more context.</p>

<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Crucially, Tax-Free Childcare is fully compatible with your free funded childcare hours. Use your 15 or 30 funded hours first, then run any additional hours or holiday care through your TFC account for the top-up. Combining the two is where the real savings stack up.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">6. How to Get the Most Out of It</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Use it for holiday clubs.</strong> This is where the TFC account earns its keep. Summer holiday childcare can cost £150–£500 per week per child. Running that through your account automatically saves 25%. One child in holiday clubs for six weeks could save you £200–£450 with zero effort beyond using the right payment method.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Set up a standing order.</strong> The most common reason families don't maximise TFC is forgetting to deposit money regularly. Set up a standing order from your bank account so funds flow in automatically each month — then the top-up appears without you having to remember anything.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Plan around the quarterly cap.</strong> The government's £500 quarterly top-up resets at the start of each quarter (roughly January, April, July and October). If you hit the cap before the quarter ends, any further deposits in that period won't receive the top-up. Plan larger payments — like booking a holiday club — for the start of a new quarter.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Use it for multiple children.</strong> Each child gets their own separate TFC account with its own £2,000 annual top-up cap. A family with two eligible children in childcare can receive up to £4,000 from the government per year — simply by routing payments through the accounts rather than paying providers directly.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">7. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
<li><strong>Not checking your provider is registered.</strong> Confirm they can accept TFC payments before you apply. It takes five seconds to ask — and if they're not registered, ask them to sign up before your application goes through.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the three-month reconfirmation.</strong> Diary the dates the moment you set up the account. A missed window suspends access and means you can't pay providers from the account until you reactivate it.</li>
<li><strong>Claiming TFC while on Universal Credit or Tax Credits.</strong> This triggers an overpayment you'll need to repay. Check your existing entitlements carefully before applying.</li>
<li><strong>Assuming you earn too much.</strong> The upper limit is £100,000 per person — not per household. A dual-income couple where both earn £95,000 each still qualifies. Many higher earners assume they're excluded when they aren't.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting school-age children qualify.</strong> Tax-Free Childcare isn't just for nursery. After-school clubs, breakfast clubs and holiday camps all count, right up until your child's 12th birthday. Many parents stop thinking about it once their child starts school — and miss out for years.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Can I use Tax-Free Childcare if I'm self-employed with variable income?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes. Self-employed parents qualify as long as you expect to earn at least £8,670 over the next quarter. HMRC uses a projected earnings figure rather than demanding proof upfront. If your income varies month to month — common for freelancers and contractors — you can still apply based on your expected earnings. If your income later comes in below the threshold, you may need to repay some top-up, so keep records of what you projected and why.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What happens if I go on maternity leave after I've opened an account?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">You can keep claiming Tax-Free Childcare during maternity, paternity, shared parental or adoption leave, even if your pay drops below the minimum threshold. The grace period lasts until the end of the pay period in which your leave ends. If you return to work and your pay goes back up above £8,670, you continue as normal. This is genuinely one of the better-designed aspects of the scheme — it doesn't penalise you for taking legitimate leave.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">My partner doesn't work. Can I still claim?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Only if it's a lone-parent household — meaning you're the only parent or you're a single parent. If you're in a couple and one of you doesn't work (and isn't on maternity leave, paternity leave, or signed off sick), you won't qualify. Both partners in a couple need to be working and clearing the minimum income threshold. This is one of the scheme's genuine limitations, and it catches a lot of families where one parent has reduced or stopped work to care for a child — ironically, the very situation where childcare costs tend to feel most burdensome.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Tax-Free Childcare isn't complicated. You open an account, you pay into it, the government adds 25%, and you use it to pay your childcare provider. The application takes 20 minutes. The ongoing admin is reconfirming your eligibility every three months.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For eligible families spending £5,000 or more a year on childcare — which describes a huge number of UK parents — the scheme is worth £1,000 to £2,000 every single year just for changing how you pay. The money is already there, waiting. The only thing required is claiming it.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Start at <a href="https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk" class="text-emerald-700 underline hover:text-emerald-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">childcarechoices.gov.uk</a> — the eligibility checker takes five minutes and tells you immediately whether you qualify.</p>
