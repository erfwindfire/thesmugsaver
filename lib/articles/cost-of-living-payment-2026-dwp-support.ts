<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">When will I receive my Cost of Living Payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If you're eligible, you should receive your £500 payment between 30 September and 13 October 2026. The exact date depends on which benefit you receive and when your normal payment is due.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Do I need to apply for the Cost of Living Payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No, you don't need to apply. If you're eligible, the payment will be made automatically to the same bank account where you receive your regular benefit payments.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">How much will I receive?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Eligible households will receive £500. This is a one-off payment per household, not per person. Joint claimants (couples) will receive one payment between them.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Will this payment affect my other benefits?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No, the Cost of Living Payment won't affect your other benefits or be counted as income for benefit calculations. It's also not subject to income tax.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What if I'm on Universal Credit with earnings?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">You'll still receive the payment if you were receiving Universal Credit on the qualifying date, even if your UC payment was reduced to £0 due to your earnings.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">I receive both UC and Tax Credits - will I get two payments?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No, you'll only receive one Cost of Living Payment per household. If you're receiving multiple qualifying benefits, you'll get the payment from the primary benefit system.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What if I was sanctioned on the qualifying date?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If you were sanctioned on 26 September 2026, you may not be eligible for this payment. However, this depends on the type of sanction and your specific circumstances. Contact DWP for clarification.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Can I receive the payment if I'm working?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, if you're receiving Working Tax Credit or Universal Credit while working, you're still eligible for the Cost of Living Payment.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What should I do if I don't receive my payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wait until two weeks after the payment window ends (27 October 2026). If you still haven't received it and believe you're eligible, contact the relevant helpline for your benefit type.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Will there be more Cost of Living Payments in 2026?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Government hasn't announced additional Cost of Living Payments beyond September 2026. Keep checking gov.uk for any future announcements about cost of living support.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What if I receive too much money or duplicate payments?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Contact DWP or HMRC immediately if you receive more than £500 or duplicate payments. You may be asked to repay the excess amount, and it's important to resolve this quickly.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Are people on Pension Credit eligible?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, if you were receiving Pension Credit (either Guarantee Credit or Savings Credit) on 26 September 2026, you're eligible for the £500 payment.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Do I qualify if I only receive contribution-based JSA?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No, contribution-based JSA alone doesn't qualify for the Cost of Living Payment. You need to be receiving income-based JSA or another qualifying means-tested benefit.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Can I appeal if I think I should have received a payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, you can request a mandatory reconsideration if you believe you were wrongly denied the payment. If you disagree with that decision, you can appeal to an independent tribunal.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Will this payment count towards the benefit cap?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No, the Cost of Living Payment is excluded from benefit cap calculations and won't affect the total amount of benefits you can receive.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">What should I do to protect myself from scams?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Never give personal details to anyone claiming to be from DWP via text, email, or phone. The payment is automatic and DWP won't ask for your information. Report any suspicious contact to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">How will the payment appear on my bank statement?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The payment will appear as "DWP COL PAYMENT" for most benefits or "HMRC COL PAYMENT" for Tax Credits. This helps you identify it as your official Cost of Living Payment.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Can students receive the Cost of Living Payment?</h3>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Students can receive the payment if they're claiming a qualifying benefit such as Universal Credit or Tax Credits. Student loans and grants don't affect eligibility.</p>
