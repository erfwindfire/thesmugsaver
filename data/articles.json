      "faqs": [
        {"q": "How do I access 211 emergency services, and what exactly can they help with?", "a": "Dial 211 from any phone (available 24/7 in 99% of the U.S., with 180+ language support) to reach trained specialists who connect you with local food banks, emergency financial assistance, utility help, housing support, and healthcare resources."},
        {"q": "Are dried beans and lentils really that much cheaper than canned?", "a": "Yes—dramatically so. Buying dried versus canned saves approximately 70% on cost. Dried legumes cost as little as 0.8-2p per gram of protein."},
        {"q": "What are food clubs, and how are they different from food banks?", "a": "Food clubs operate on a hybrid model: instead of emergency food parcels, you purchase a week's worth of groceries (retail value $10-15) for $3.50-4."},
        {"q": "Can I really feed my family on $40 per week?", "a": "Mathematically, yes—but it requires significant constraint, planning, and sacrifice of variety."},
        {"q": "What should I prioritize buying if I can only afford staples?", "a": "Priority order: dried beans/lentils, rice/pasta, eggs, cooking oil, onions/garlic, carrots/cabbage, canned tomatoes, oats, peanut butter, basic spices."},
        {"q": "How can I minimize food waste when every dollar counts?", "a": "Save vegetable scraps for broth, repurpose leftovers systematically, batch cook on weekends, store foods properly, delete takeout apps."},
        {"q": "Should I get a warehouse club membership like Costco or Sam's Club?", "a": "Depends on upfront cost ($60-100 annually), storage space, and transportation. Consider splitting membership costs with friends or family."},
        {"q": "What resources exist specifically for children's meals?", "a": "School meal programs, breakfast programs, after-school programs, summer meal programs, community centers, libraries, and religious organizations."},
        {"q": "Is it safe to accept food from community fridges or informal distribution?", "a": "Community fridges operate on a mutual aid model. Reasonable safety practices apply: avoid unpackaged items, check expiration dates, cook perishables thoroughly."},
        {"q": "What if I need help but feel too ashamed to ask?", "a": "The shame around needing food assistance is a cultural construct. 42 million Americans face this simultaneously. Accessing resources is the rational response."}

        {"q": "Are round-up apps actually safe with my bank details?", "a": "Reputable apps use read-only access through Open Banking. Look for regulated apps with 256-bit encryption and two-factor authentication."},
        {"q": "Can I automate savings if I'm paid weekly or fortnightly?", "a": "Absolutely. Match automation frequency to your pay schedule. Set up transfers 1-2 days after payday."},
