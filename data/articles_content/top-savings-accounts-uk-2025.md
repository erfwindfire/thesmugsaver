# Top Savings Accounts Beating Inflation in 2025

### Key Points
*   **Inflation Status**: CPI Inflation is approx 2.3%.
*   **Savings Leaders**: Top easy-access accounts pay ~4.8%. Fixed bonds pay ~5.2%.

Saving money used to be a losing game. In 2022, inflation was 10% and savings paid 1%. You lost 9% a year.
In 2025, the tables have turned. Cash is King.

Here are the accounts to open today.

## 1. The "Easy Access" Leaders (Funds you need anytime)
*   **Rate Target**: 4.75% - 5.00%.
*   **Top Picks**:
    *   **Chip**: Often pays a bonus on top of base rate.
    *   **Trading 212 Cash**: Pays high interest on uninvested cash.
    *   **Monument**: Great app, high rates (requires £25k min balance).
*   **Rule**: Never accept <4.5%.

## 2. The "Regular Savers" (Drip-feeding cash)
*   **Rate Target**: 6.00% - 8.00%.
*   **How**: You can only put in £200-£300 a month.
*   **Top Picks**:
    *   **First Direct**: 7% Regular Saver.
    *   **Nationwide**: 6.5% FlexRegular Saver.
    *   **Skipton Building Society**.

## 3. The "Notice Accounts" (Wait 30-90 days)

## FAQ: Savings

### Is my money safe in these "App" banks?
Check for **FSCS Protection**. If it has it, the UK Govt protects £85,000 per person, per banking license.
*   *Note*: Some apps share a license (e.g., HSBC and First Direct). The limit is £85k *total* across the group.

### Should I choose Monthly or Annual Interest?
**Monthly**. It allows the interest to compound (interest earning interest) slightly faster within the year.

### What is a "Sharia" Account?
Banks like Al Rayan or Gatehouse offer "Expected Profit Rates" instead of Interest (to comply with Islamic law). They often top the "Best Buy" tables. Anyone can open them. They are FSCS protected.

## Conclusion
Loyalty costs you money. If your bank is paying 1.5% (common with big high street names), you are donating your potential returns to their shareholders. Move your money. It takes 10 minutes.
