# Financial Survival Skills for UK Students in 2025—Budgeting, Housing, Food & Work Hacks

### Key Points
*   **The Deficit**: The Maintenance Loan rarely covers Rent + Living costs. The average shortfall is £400/month. You *need* a plan to plug gap.
*   **Zero-rated Overdrafts**: Student bank accounts offer up to £3,000 interest-free overdrafts. This is the cheapest debt you will ever get. Use it for emergencies, not shots.
*   **Council Tax Exemption**: Students pay £0 Council Tax. If you live with non-students, ensure the household gets the discount.
*   **Hardship Funds**: Every university has a pot of cash for struggling students. It is under-claimed. Ask the Student Union.

Being a student in 2025 is tough. Rents are high. Loans haven't kept up with inflation.
The "Student Experience" is now an exercise in cash flow management.

## 1. Banking: The Golden Handcuffs
Open a **Student Bank Account** (Santander, HSBC, Natwest).
*   **Perk 1**: Free Railcard (Save 1/3 on travel). Worth £100s.
*   **Perk 2**: 0% Overdraft.
*   **Rule**: Never go *over* the arranged limit. The fees are astronomical. Treat the overdraft as a "Buffer", not "Income".

## 2. Discounts: Never Pay Full Price
*   **UNiDAYS / StudentBeans**: Download them. Flash them everywhere.
*   **McDonalds**: Free cheeseburger/McFlurry with a meal if you show ID.
*   **Spotify/Prime**: Students get 50% off.
*   **Technology**: Apple/Samsung have separate "Student Stores" with ~10% off laptops.

## 3. The Job: Tax-Free Earnings
You have a "Personal Allowance" of £12,570. You can earn this tax-free.
*   **Holiday Pay**: If you work part-time (bar/shop), you accrue holiday pay. Many students forget to claim it when they leave. That’s free money.
*   **Side Hustles**: Tutoring GCSE students pays £20/hour. Bar work pays £11/hour. Be the tutor.

## 4. Housing: The Next Year Trap
In November, panic sets in to book a house for *next* September.
*   **Don't Rush**: Agents create false scarcity. "Sign now or it's gone!"
*   **Check**: Does the rent include bills? If not, Energy + Internet adds £80/person/month.
*   **Deposit Protection**: Ensure your deposit goes into a "Tenancy Deposit Scheme". It is illegal for the landlord to just "hold it".

If you earn £24,000, you pay £0.
If you lose your job, you pay £0.
It does not affect your credit rating (unlike credit cards).
**Do not** overpay it to "clear it early". It is the cheapest loan you will ever have.

Lidl/Aldi. Learn to cook pasta bake.
**Too Good To Go**: The app lets you pick up unsold sushi/sandwiches from Pret for £3. Perfect for library study sessions.

## Conclusion
University is an investment. Manage the cash flow so you can focus on the degree, not the hunger. Use the overdraft wisely, claim every discount, and treat the loan as a tax, not a burden.
