# 10 Grocery Saving Hacks You Haven't Tried Yet (UK Edition)

### Key Points
*   **The "Yellow Sticker" Golden Hour**: 7pm is usually the best time for 75% off reductions.
*   **Loyalty 2.0**: Stacking Tesco Clubcard prices with cashback apps (Shopmium/CheckoutSmart).
*   **The "Wonky" Veg Revolution**: Buying imperfect veg boxes saves 40%.
*   **Downshifting**: Moving from "Taste the Difference" to "Sainsburys" to "Hubbard's" (Value).

UK supermarkets are in a fierce price war. This benefits the savvy shopper. Here is how to exploit the specific quirks of the British grocery market.

## 1. Timing the Yellow Stickers
Supermarkets reduce prices in waves.
*   10am: 25% off (First wave).
*   4pm: 50% off (Second wave).
*   **7pm: 75% off (The Clearance)**.
*   Go at 7:30pm to grab bread, meat, and ready meals for pennies. Freeze them immediately.

## 2. The Cashback Stack
Apps like "Shopmium" and "CheckoutSmart" give you cash back for buying specific new products.
*   **Hack**: Sometimes they offer 100% cashback (Free). Sometimes the cashback + a yellow sticker means they *pay you* to take it away.

## 3. "Wonky" Vegetables
Morrisons "Wonky", Tesco "Imperfectly Tasty", Lidl "Too Good to Waste".
*   Carrots are carrots. Who cares if they are bent? You're going to chop them anyway.
*   **Saving**: Often 50p/kg vs 90p/kg.

## 4. The World Foods Aisle
Buying spices (Cumin, Paprika), Rice, and Lentils in the "World Foods" aisle is drastically cheaper than the "Spice Rack" aisle.
*   100g Cardamom (World): £2.00.
*   30g Cardamom (Schwartz): £2.50.

## 5. Trolley.co.uk
This comparison site lets you compare your basket across Asda, Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrison, Iceland.
*   **Impact**: Shows you if you are overpaying for your specific brand of coffee instantly.

## 6. The "Bottom Shelf"
Brands pay for eye-level slots. Look down. The "Value" range (50p pasta vs £1.50 pasta) is always on the bottom shelf.

## 7. Use the "Smart Shop" Handsets
Scanning as you shop (e.g., Nectar Smart Shop) tracks your total.
*   **Psychology**: Watching the total rise stops you throwing in random treats.
*   **Bonus**: Often get exclusive "My Nectar" prices.

## 8. Frozen Over Fresh
UK winters mean fresh produce is imported and expensive. Frozen peas, spinach, and berries are cheaper and retain nutrients better.
*   **Bonus**: No food waste. Only defrost what you need.

## 9. Amazon Subscribe & Save
For bulk items (Toilet roll, dishwasher tablets, cat food).
*   **Hack**: Often 15% cheaper than supermarkets if you subscribe. Set it to deliver every 3 months.

## 10. Too Good To Go
The app where shops sell "Magic Bags" of unsold food for £3.30.
*   **Pret / Costa / Greggs**: Great for a cheap lunch.
*   **Supermarkets**: Often get £15 of groceries for £4.

## Conclusion
The UK grocery market is competitive. Loyalty doesn't pay; promiscuity does. Shop around, time your visits, and exploit the apps to slash your bill.
