# Simple UK Bank Account Hacks to Maximise Interest in 2025

### Key Points
*   **The "Stoozing" Revival**: Using 0% purchase cards to hold your spending money in savings accounts earning 5%.
*   **The Switching Merry-Go-Round**: Earning £1,000/year purely from bank switch bonuses.
*   **Linked Savers**: Current accounts that give you access to exclusive 7-8% savings accounts.
*   **Cashback on Bills**: Santander Edge / Natwest Reward accounts pay you to pay your bills.

Your bank account should be a profit center, not just a bucket.
If you pay a monthly fee for your account, you are likely losing money unless you use the insurance perks.
If your account is "Free" but pays 0% interest, you are losing money to inflation.

## Hack 1: The Switch Bonus Cycle
Banks pay "Bribes" to acquire you.
*   **The Offer**: "Switch to Natwest, we pay you £200."
*   **The Strategy**:
    *   Open a "Burner Account" (e.g., a secondary Monzo).
    *   Switch it to Natwest. Get £200.
    *   Wait 3 months. Switch the Natwest account to Lloyds. Get £175.
    *   Repeat.
*   **Profit**: easily £800+ per year tax-free.

## Hack 2: The "Linked Saver" 
Open a dedicated Current Account just to get the savings rate.
*   **First Direct**: Open 1st Account -> Get access to 7% Regular Saver.
*   **Club Lloyds**: Open Account -> Get access to 6.25% Saver + Free Disney+.

## Hack 3: "Stoozing" (Advanced)
*   **Concept**: Spend on credit, save the cash.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Get a **0% Purchase Credit Card** (e.g., 20 months 0%).
    2.  Put ALL spending (Food, Fuel) on the card.
    3.  Put the cash you *would* have spent into a **5% Savings Account**.
    4.  Pay the *minimum* on the card.
    5.  At month 19, use the savings (which have grown by 5%) to pay off the card in full. Keep the interest.

## Hack 4: Cashback on Bills
*   **Santander Edge**: Cost £3/mo. Pays 1% cashback on Bills (Council Tax, Energy, Water) and 1% on Supermarkets.
*   **Math**: If bills + food = £1,000/mo, you earn £20. Minus £3 fee = £17 profit per month (£204/year).

## FAQ: Bank Hacks

### Does switching hurt my credit score?
A tiny dip (due to a hard search) for 3 months. Then it recovers. Don't do it if you are applying for a mortgage in the next 6 months. Otherwise, it's fine.

### Is "Stoozing" dangerous?
Only if you spend the savings! You must be disciplined. The money in the savings account is NOT yours; it belongs to the credit card company. You are just earning interest on it for a while.

### Can I have multiple current accounts?
Yes. You can have 10 if you want. It helps to separate "Spending" from "Bills" anyway.

## Conclusion
Banks make billions from inertia. They bank on you being too lazy to move. Prove them wrong. Take the bribe, take the interest, and rinse and repeat.
