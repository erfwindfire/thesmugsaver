# UK Budget 2025: What Rachel Reeves' Autumn Statement Means for Your Money

### Key Points
*   **Fiscal Drag**: Tax thresholds remain frozen. As wages rise, millions more are dragged into 40% tax.
*   **Capital Gains Tax (CGT)**: Rates aligned closer to Income Tax. Selling a second home or shares is now more expensive.
*   **Inheritance Tax (IHT)**: Reliefs on Business and Agricultural land tightened. More estates will pay.
*   **Pensions**: The "Triple Lock" stays, but the tax-free lump sum is under review.

*Note: This article analyzes the projected impact of the 2024/25 statements.*

The Chancellor's strategy is clear: "Growth" is the goal, but "Balance the Books" is the rule.
For the personal freelancer, investor, or employee, the "Stealth Taxes" are the ones to watch.

## 1. The "Stealth" Income Tax Rise
There was no headline rate rise. The basic rate is still 20%.
*   **The Trap**: The Personal Allowance is frozen at £12,570.
*   **Impact**: Inflation means you need a pay rise to stand still. But that pay rise pushes you over £12,570 (taxable) or £50,270 (higher rate).
*   **Result**: Your *effective* tax rate has gone up.

## 2. Capital Gains Tax (The Landlord Hit)
*   **Change**: The Annual Exempt Amount is now a tiny £3,000.
*   **Impact**: If you sell shares or a Buy-to-Let, you pay tax on almost all the profit.
*   **Action**: Use your **ISA** and **Pension** wrappers. They are immune to CGT. Harvesting gains inside an ISA is the only shelter left.

## 3. Inheritance Tax (The Middle Class Trap)
*   **Threshold**: Frozen at £325k.
*   **Impact**: Rising house prices mean modest semi-detached houses in the South East are now pushing estates into IHT territory.
*   **Strategy**: "Gifting out of income". If you have surplus income, give it away *now*. Gifts made from regular income are immediately exempt from IHT (no 7 year rule).

## 4. Stamp Duty (First Time Buyers)
*   **Change**: The temporary relief (0% on first £425k) is set to end in March 2025. It reverts to £300k.
*   **Impact**: A rush to complete purchases before April 2025.
*   **Action**: If buying, push for completion. A delay could cost you £6,250 in tax.

## FAQ: Budget Impact

### Did Fuel Duty go up?
Usually frozen again. It is politically too toxic to raise it for white-van man.

### Are ISAs safe?
Yes. The £20,000 allowance remains. There were rumors of a "British ISA" (extra £5k for UK stocks), but simplicity is preferred.

### What should I do about the Threshold Freeze?
**Pension Contributions**. It is the only way to lower your "Adjusted Net Income". If the freeze pushes you into the 40% band, putting more in your pension brings you back down to 20% (and gives you 40% tax relief).

## Conclusion
The era of "Tax Cuts" is over. We are in an era of "Fiscal Drag". The only defense is tax-efficient wrappers: ISAs and Private Pensions. Maximize them before you pay the taxman.
