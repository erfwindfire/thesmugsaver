# Switch Broadband, Mobile & TV UK 2025: Save £500+ Guide

### Key Points
*   **The "One Touch" Switch**: New Ofcom rules (One Touch Switch) mean you only talk to the *new* provider. They handle the cancellation with the old one. No more awkward "Please don't leave" conversations.
*   **The "Alt-Net" Revolution**: Using smaller providers (Community Fibre, Hyperoptic) is often 50% cheaper and 10x faster than the big names (BT/Virgin).
*   **Social Tariffs**: If you are on benefits, you can get fibre broadband for £12.50/month.
*   **Sim-Only logic**: Never buy a phone on contract. Buy refurbished, get a £7 SIM.

In 2025, loyalty is a tax. The "New Customer" deal is always, mathematically, better than the "Loyal Customer" renewal price.
The barriers to switching have been demolished by regulators. It now takes 10 minutes on a smartphone.

## Broadband: The Alt-Nets

The UK is being dug up. "Alt-Nets" (Alternative Networks) are laying their own cables.
*   **Big Boys (BT/Sky)**: 60mbps = £35/month.
*   **Alt-Net (Hyperoptic/Community Fibre)**: 150mbps = £22/month.
*   **Check**: Use a site like "Bidb.uk" (Better Internet Dashboard) to see exactly who digs up your street.

## Mobile: The MVNO Hack

Why pay EE £25/month when "1p Mobile" uses the *exact same* EE network for £10/month?
*   **MVNO**: Mobile Virtual Network Operator. They rent the towers from the Big 4 (EE, O2, Vodafone, Three) but charge half the price.
*   **O2 Network**: Use **GiffGaff** or **Tesco Mobile**.
*   **EE Network**: Use **1p Mobile** or **Lyca**.
*   **Vodafone Network**: Use **Voxi** or **Lebara**.
*   **Three Network**: Use **Smarty** or **ID Mobile**.

## TV: Ditch the Dish

Sky Q/Glass is expensive (£40+).
*   **Stream**: Services like Netflix/Disney+ offer "Ad Supported" tiers for £4.99.
*   **Freeview Play**: Offers 95% of what you actually watch (BBC/ITV/Ch4) for £0.
*   **Rotation**: subscribe to Sky Sports *only* for the F1 season or Football season. Cancel in the off-season.

## FAQ: Switching

### Will I lose internet during the switch?
With "One Touch Switch", the downtime is usually <1 hour. The new provider coordinates the activation date perfectly with the cancellation.

### Can I keep my number?
**Yes.** Text "PAC" to 65075. You get a code instantly. Give it to the new network. Done.

### What if I am mid-contract?
You will pay "Early Termination Fees". Do the math. If the fee is £50, but the new deal saves you £20/month for 12 months (£240), it is worth paying the fee to leave.

## Conclusion
The infrastructure of the UK is shared. The signal from a £6 Lebara SIM is identical to a £30 Vodafone SIM. Stop paying for the brand logo. Pay for the data.
