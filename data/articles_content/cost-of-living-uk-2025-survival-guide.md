# Cost of Living UK 2025: Survival Guide (Deep Dive)

### Key Points
*   **Housing Support**: Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) are the secret weapon for rent arrears.
*   **Water Bills**: The "Social Tariff" system can cut bills by 50% for low earners.
*   **Broadband**: "Social Tariffs" exist for anyone on Universal Credit (£12/month for fiber).

When you have cut every latte and cancelled every Netflix, and the math still doesn't work, you need structural support. This guide focuses on the "Hardship" tier of savings.

## Housing: DHP
If Universal Credit housing element doesn't cover your rent, apply to your Council for a **Discretionary Housing Payment**.
*   **It is pot-luck**: Each council has a budget. When it's gone, it's gone. Apply in April (new financial year) for best success.

## Water: The "Assessed Charge"
If you can't have a water meter (shared block), ask for an **Assessed Charge**. They maintain a bill based on average usage (often cheaper than Rateable Value).
If on benefits, apply for the Water Company's **Social Tariff** (capped bills).

## Broadband: Social Tariffs
If you are on UC, you are legally entitled to cheap internet.
*   **BT Home Essentials**: £15/mo.
*   **Virgin Media Essentials**: £12.50/mo.
*   **Performance**: It is usually standard fiber (30-50mbps). Plenty for HD streaming. You do not need 500mbps.

## Conclusion
There is a "Shadow Welfare State" provided by utility companies (Social Tariffs). They do not advertise it. You have to ask. If you are eligible, claim it. It is not charity; it is regulation.
