# Buy Now, Pay Later vs Credit Cards: Which Is Safer for UK Consumers in 2025?

### Key Points
*   **Regulation Shift**: As of 2025, BNPL is finally under FCA supervision, bringing stronger protections but tighter checks.
*   **The Protection Gap**: Credit cards offer Section 75 protection (vital for items >£100); BNPL generally does not.
*   **Cost of Debt**: BNPL is usually 0% interest; Credit cards average 24% APR if not paid in full.
*   **Credit Score Impact**: Both now actively report to credit reference agencies. Missed payments on either will hurt you.

The way we pay for things in the UK has fundamentally fractured. On one side, the traditional Credit Card: robust, regulated, but potentially expensive. On the other, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL): slick, interest-free, but historically a "Wild West" of unregulated debt.

In 2025, the landscape has changed. The FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) has clamped down on BNPL, narrowing the gap between the two. But they are still very different tools with different risks.

Choosing the wrong one can cost you hundreds in interest, wreck your mortgage application, or leave you without legal recourse if a retailer goes bust. This article breaks down exactly which tool to use, when, and why.

## The Core Difference: Section 75 vs. Consumer Rights Act

This is the single most important distinction.

**Credit Cards** provide coverage under **Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act**.
*   **The Power**: If you buy something between £100 and £30,000, the card provider is *jointly liable* with the retailer.
*   **Scenario**: You buy a £500 sofa. The sofa company goes bust before delivery.
    *   **On Credit Card**: The bank refunds you the £500. No questions asked.
    *   **On BNPL**: You are *not* covered by Section 75. You are reliant on the provider's own buyer protection policies (which vary) or "Chargeback" (which is not law, just a scheme rule).

**Verdict**: For anything over £100, especially travel or deliveries, **Credit Card wins**.

## The Cost of Borrowing: 0% vs. 24% APR

**BNPL (Klarna, Clearpay, Monzo Flex)**
*   **Cost**: Typically 0% interest if you pay on time (usually over 3 months).
*   **The Trap**: Late fees. If you miss a payment, you get hit with a fixed fee (e.g., £6). More dangerously, some providers now charge interest on longer terms (6-12 months).

**Credit Cards**
*   **Cost**: Average 24% APR.
*   **The Trap**: Minimum payments. Paying only the minimum turns a £500 purchase into a £1,000 debt over years.

**Verdict**: For short-term cash flow management (paying over 3 months), **BNPL wins**—*if* you never miss a payment.

## Credit Score Impact: The Myth of "No Footprint"

In the past, BNPL didn't show up on your credit file. **This is no longer true in 2025.**
*   **Hard Checks**: Opening a BNPL account now often involves a hard credit check, just like a credit card.
*   **Visibility**: Lenders (mortgage providers, car finance) can see your BNPL debts. Having active BNPL debts can reduce your affordability assessment.
*   **Utilization**: Maxing out your BNPL limit looks just as bad as maxing out a credit card.

## Strategic Framework: When to Use Which

Do not treat them as interchangeable. Use this framework:

### Use BNPL When:
1.  The purchase is **under £100** (below Section 75 threshold).
2.  You are **100% certain** you can repay within the 3-month window.
3.  You are buying **goods you have received** (e.g., trying on clothes at home).

### Use a Credit Card When:
1.  The purchase is **over £100** (Section 75 protection).
2.  You are booking **travel or future services** (flights, hotels).
3.  You need to borrow for **longer than 3 months** (look for a 0% Purchase Credit Card instead).
4.  You are actively trying to **build a credit history** (cards are still the gold standard for this).

## FAQ: BNPL vs Credit Cards

### Does BNPL affect my mortgage application?
Yes. Lenders look at outgoing commitments. If you have £200/month going out to Klarna/Clearpay, that is £200 less limit on your monthly mortgage affordability. Clear all BNPL debts 3-6 months before applying for a mortgage.

### Can I get Section 75 protection if I pay the deposit on Credit Card and the rest on BNPL?
Yes! As long as the *total value* of the item is between £100-£30,000, paying even £1 deposit on a credit card triggers Section 75 liability for the *whole amount*. This is a powerful "hybrid" hack.

### Is Monzo Flex BNPL or a Credit Card?
Monzo Flex is a hybrid but is regulated as a credit product. It offers Section 75 protection on eligible purchases, making it one of the safer BNPL-style options.

### What happens if I miss a BNPL payment?
1. You may be charged a late fee.
2. Your account may be frozen (no more spending).
3. The missed payment will be reported to credit agencies (Experian/Equifax), damaging your score for 6 years.

### Which is better for building credit?
A Credit Card is better. It demonstrates long-term stability and responsible utilization of a revolving limit. BNPL is seen as more "transactional" and carries less weight with premium lenders.

## Conclusion

BNPL is a useful tool for cash flow—smoothing out a clothing haul or a mid-month expense without interest. But it lacks the legal muscle of Section 75 protection. For serious purchases, travel, or anything expensive, the Credit Card remains the professional's choice. In 2025, the smart consumer uses both, but never confuses the two.
