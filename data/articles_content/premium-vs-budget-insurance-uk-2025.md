# Premium vs Budget Insurance: How Not to Get Ripped Off in 2025

### Key Points
*   **The Defaqto Rating**: Ignore the brand name. Look for the Star Rating. A 5-Star budget policy is better than a 3-Star premium one.
*   **The "Legal Cover" Upsell**: 90% of people tick this box (£30). Check your Home Insurance; you probably already have it included.
*   **The "Courtesy Car" Trap**: "Guaranteed Hire Car" sounds great, but budget policies often give you a tiny hatchback while your SUV is fixed. Premium policies give "Like for Like".
*   **Home Emergency**: Do you need it? If you have a decent emergency fund (£500), self-insuring a burst pipe is cheaper over 5 years.

Insurance is a "Grudge Purchase". We hate buying it. So we either buy the cheapest (risky) or the most recognized brand (expensive).

In 2025, the "Budget" brands (think: Sheila's Wheels, Hastings Essential) are often underwritten by the same massive insurers (AXA, Aviva) as the premium brands. The difference is in the *service levels*, not the ability to pay out.

## Car Insurance: Where to Cut

### 1. Legal Protection (£30/year)
*   **What**: Pays legal fees if you sue someone after a crash.
*   **Cut it?**: Check your Home Insurance or Union Membership. You might be double covered.

### 2. Breakdown Cover (£60/year)
*   **What**: AA/RAC at the roadside.
*   **Cut it?**: Buying it via your insurer is expensive. Buying it via a cashback site (TopCashback) as a standalone product is often £20 cheaper. Or get it free with a packaged bank account (Nationwide/Halifax).

### 3. Key Cover (£20/year)
*   **Cut it?**: Modern keys cost £300 to replace. But how often do you lose them? Self-insure.

## Home Insurance: The "Premium" Worth Paying

**Trace and Access**.
*   **Scenario**: A pipe bursts under your floor. The leak damage is £500. Digging up the floor to find it costs £3,000.
*   **Budget Policy**: Pays for the £500 damage. Won't pay for digging the floor. You are ruined.
*   **Premium Policy**: Pays for "Trace and Access" (finding the leak).
*   **Rule**: Never buy a home policy without Trace and Access cover of at least £5,000.

## Travel Insurance: The "Medical" Line
Don't look at "Baggage". Look at **Medical**.
*   **Target**: £10 million medical cover.
*   **Why**: A helicopter in the USA costs $50,000. £1m cover isn't enough.
*   **Budget vs Premium**: Budget policies often have high "Excess" (£200). If you lose a £250 camera, claiming is pointless.

## FAQ: Insurance

### Does loyalty pay?
**Never.** The "FCA Loyalty Ban" stopped them charging existing customers *more* than new ones, but it didn't stop them increasing prices for everyone. Always compare.

### Is "Fully Comprehensive" always cheapest?
Weirdly, yes. "Third Party Only" is bought by high-risk drivers, so the algorithms discourage it. Always quote Fully Comp.

### What is "Voluntary Excess"?
The amount you pay towards a claim. Increasing it from £250 to £500 can drop your premium by £50. If you are a safe driver (low claim risk), take the higher excess.

## Conclusion
Don't buy "Premium" for the brand. Buy "Budget" but check the small print for **Trace and Access** (Home) and **Courtesy Car** (Car). That is the sweet spot.
