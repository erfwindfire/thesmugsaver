# How to Save £100k in 8 Years: Complete UK Strategy

### Key Points
*   **The Number**: To hit £100k in 8 years, you need to save **£900/month** (assuming 4% growth).
*   **The Vehicle**: Using a **Stocks & Shares ISA** is essential. Cash savings will lose to inflation over an 8-year horizon.
*   **The Split**: For a couple, this is £450 each. A realistic target for dual-income households.
*   **The Accelerator**: Increasing contributions by 5% each year cuts the timeline to 7 years.

£100,000 is a "Life Changing" number. It is a house deposit in London. It is a "Retire Early" fund. It is "F-You Money".

It sounds impossible. But broken down, it is a math problem.
If you save £0 and want £100k in 8 years:
*   **Cash (0% interest)**: You need to save £1,041/month.
*   **Invested (5% return)**: You need to save **£830/month**.

Compound interest does the heavy lifting of that final £20k. Here is the roadmap.

## Year 1-2: The Foundation (Cash ISAs)
*   **Goal**: Build the first £20k.
*   **Strategy**: Maximize high-interest Cash ISAs (currently ~4.5%).
*   **Why**: You need a solid base that won't fluctuate if the market crashes tomorrow.
*   **Action**: Set up a standing order for £450/month (per person if a couple). Treat it like a tax. You never see it.

## Year 3-8: The Growth (Index Funds)
*   **Strategy**: Switch to a **Stocks & Shares ISA**.
*   **Asset**: Buy a low-cost "Global All Cap" Index Fund (e.g., Vanguard, HSBC).
*   **Why**: Over 8 years, the stock market historically returns 7-8% (though we model safely at 5%). Cash will lag.
*   **Risk**: The graph will go down sometimes. In Year 5, you might lose money. **Do not sell.** 8 years is long enough to ride out a recession.

## The "Lifestyle Creep" Accelerator
Most people get pay rises over 8 years. Most people spend it.
*   **The Rule**: If you get a £2,000 pay rise, £1,000 goes to the saved monthly amount. £1,000 goes to lifestyle.
*   **Impact**: Increasing your contribution from £900 to £1,200 in Year 4 means you hit £100k in Year 7, not Year 8.

## FAQ: Saving £100k

### Is it tax-free?
Yes. If you use an ISA (Individual Savings Account), you pay £0 Capital Gains Tax and £0 Income Tax on the growth. You can put in £20,000 per year.

### What if I want to buy a house in Year 4?
If the goal is a house, use a **Lifetime ISA (LISA)** for the first £4,000/year. The Govt adds 25% (£1,000). This is "Free Money" that beats any stock market return.

### Can I do this on an average salary?
£900/month is hard on a single £35k salary (Take home ~£2,300).
It is very achievable for a couple earning £30k each (Household take home ~£4,000). It requires living on £3,100 and saving £900.

## Conclusion
£100,000 is not a lottery win. It is the result of boring, consistent, automated habits over 96 months. The time will pass anyway. You might as well have the money at the end of it.
