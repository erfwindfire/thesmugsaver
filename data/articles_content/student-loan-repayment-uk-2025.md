# Student Loan Repayment in 2025: UK Survival Guide for Every Plan Type

### Key Points
*   **The "Graduate Tax" Mindset**: Stop viewing it as a debt. View it as a 9% tax on earnings above the threshold. If you earn less, you pay nothing.
*   **Plan 2 vs Plan 5**: The new "Plan 5" (for 2023 starters) has a lower repayment threshold (£25,000) and a longer write-off period (40 years).
*   **The Overpayment Trap**: For most people, overpaying is a financial mistake. The debt will likely be written off before you clear it.
*   **Interest Rates**: Plan 2 interest is RPI + 3% (currently very high). This looks scary, but because repayment is income-contingent, the interest rate is often irrelevant to what you actually pay.

In the UK, Student Loans are the most misunderstood financial product. They are not like credit cards. They do not affect your credit score. Bailiffs will not come for you.

However, they do reduce your take-home pay. Understanding which Plan you are on is the first step to managing them.

## Know Your Plan (The 2025 Thresholds)

### Plan 1 (Started pre-2012)
*   **Threshold**: £24,990.
*   **Rate**: 9% of earnings above this.
*   **Interest**: Low (Tracked to Bank of England base rate).
*   **Strategy**: Pay it off slowly. The interest is cheap.

### Plan 2 (Started 2012-2022)
*   **Threshold**: £27,295 (Frozen until 2027).
*   **Rate**: 9% of earnings above this.
*   **Interest**: High (RPI + up to 3%).
*   **Strategy**: **DO NOT OVERPAY.** Unless you are a very high earner (>£60k) likely to clear the whole debt, overpayments just reduce a number that will eventually be deleted anyway.

### Plan 5 (Started 2023+)
*   **Threshold**: £25,000.
*   **Rate**: 9% above this.
*   **Term**: Written off after **40 years** (used to be 30).
*   **Impact**: You will pay back significantly more over your lifetime than Plan 2 graduates.

## The Overpayment Myth

"I hate debt. I should throw my savings at my student loan."
**WRONG.**
*   **Scenario**: You owe £50,000. You earn £35,000. You pay ~£700/year.
*   **Math**: In 30 years, you will have paid £21,000. The remaining balance (plus massive interest) is written off.
*   **Mistake**: If you used £10,000 of savings to pay down the debt today, you still pay £700/year. You have just burned £10,000 for zero benefit.

## FAQ: Student Loans

### Does it affect my mortgage?
**Yes**, but only affordability. The bank sees lower take-home pay, so they might lend you slightly less (e.g., 4.5x your *net* salary). It does NOT affect your credit score or history.

### What if I move abroad?
You still have to pay. The Student Loans Company has global reach. You simply fill in an "Overseas Income Assessment" form. The repayment threshold varies by country (e.g., lower in Thailand, higher in Dubai).

### Can I get a refund?
**Yes!** If you earned below the threshold *annually* but paid monthly (e.g., you had a high-paying job for 3 months then quit), you overpaid. Call SLC to reclaim it. Millions are unclaimed.

## Conclusion
Treat your Student Loan like Income Tax. It is deducted automatically. Forget the "Total Balance" figure—it is Monopoly money. Focus on the monthly impact and keep your real savings for a house deposit.
