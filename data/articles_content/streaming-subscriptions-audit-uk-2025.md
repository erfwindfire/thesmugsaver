# The Real Cost of Streaming, Subscriptions, and How to Ruthlessly Audit Yours (2025)

### Key Points
*   **The "Zombie" Sub**: 40% of people pay for a subscription they haven't used in 3 months.
*   **The "Stacking" Effect**: Netflix (£11) + Spotify (£11) + Prime (£9) + Disney (£8) + Gym (£30) = £69/mo. That is **£828/year**.
*   **The Rotation Method**: Subscribe to Disney+ for 1 month. Binge the show. Cancel. Subscribe to Netflix. Binge. Cancel.
*   **The Audit**: Scrolling your bank statement is boring. Use an app to find them.

We live in the Subscription Economy. Companies realized that selling you a DVD for £10 one-off is bad business. Charging you £10/month forever is great business.

They rely on your inertia. They rely on you forgetting.
In 2025, reclaiming that £800/year is the easiest pay rise you can give yourself.

## The Strategy: "Kill and Revive"

1.  **The Blackout**: Go into your bank app. Cancel every single Direct Debit/Standing Order for media (Netflix, Disney, Spotify, Sky, Audible).
2.  **The Wait**: Wait until you physically miss it.
    *   Day 1: You try to watch Netflix. Can't. "Oh well."
    *   Day 3: You really want to watch *Stranger Things*.
    *   **Action**: Re-subscribe.
3.  **The Result**: You will re-subscribe to the 2 things you love. You will forget the 4 things you don't. You just saved £40/month.

## The "Family Plan" Arbitrage
*   **Spotify**: Individual = £10.99. Family (6 people) = £17.99.
*   **Math**: Find 5 friends/family. Split the bill. Cost per person = **£3.00**.
*   **Legality**: Terms vary (some require same address), but enforcement is loose. At minimum, share with your actual housemates/partner.

## The "Annual" Discount
If you *must* have it (e.g., Disney+), pay annually.
*   Monthly: £7.99 x 12 = £95.88.
*   Annual: £79.90.
*   **Saving**: ~16% (2 months free).

## FAQ: Subscriptions

### What about Sky vs NOW TV?
Sky is a 24-month contract (Hard to leave). NOW TV is a rolling monthly contract (Easy to leave).
**Tactic**: Use NOW TV. Buy the "Entertainment Pass" for £9.99 when a show is on. Cancel when it ends. Avoid the "Long Contract Trap".

### Can I get refunds for unused subs?
Generally no. But if it just renewed yesterday, email them: "I intended to cancel. I haven't used the service. Please refund." 50% of the time, they will.

### How do I stop "Free Trials" charging me?
The moment you start the free trial, go to settings and **Cancel Membership**.
*   **Result**: The service usually continues until the 30 days are up, but it won't auto-renew.
*   (Some aggressive apps stop service immediately, so check first).

## Conclusion
Treat subscriptions like a tap. Turn them on when you are thirsty. Turn them off when you walk away. Leaving the tap running is just wasting liquidity.
