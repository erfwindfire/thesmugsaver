# First-Time Home Buyer Schemes UK: What's New in 2025?

### Key Points
*   **The Landscape**: Interest rates have settled (~4.5%), but house prices remain resilient. The deposit is the biggest barrier.
*   **Lifetime ISA (LISA)**: The single best tool. The Govt gives you £1,000 free cash if you save £4,000.
*   **Shared Ownership**: Reforms have made it easier to "staircase" (buy more shares) in 1% chunks, reducing the admin fees.
*   **First Homes Scheme**: A 30-50% discount on new builds for local first-time buyers and key workers.

Buying a house in 2025 feels like trying to jump onto a moving train. The average deposit is now £53,000 (UK) and £110,000 (London).

However, the Government is desperate to keep the "Property Ladder" moving. If the bottom rung breaks, the whole market stalls. That is why schemes exist.

If you are buying your first home, DO NOT do it without checking these three pillars.

## 1. The Lifetime ISA (The "No Brainer")
If you are aged 18-39, open one today with £1.
*   **The Deal**: You save up to £4,000/year. The Govt adds 25% (£1,000).
*   **The Limit**: The house must cost <£450,000.
*   **The Strategy**: If buying as a couple, you can **both** have one. That is £2,000 free cash every year towards your deposit.
*   **Warning**: If you withdraw the money for anything *other* than a house (or retirement), you pay a 25% penalty.

## 2. The First Homes Scheme (The "Lottery")
This is the most generous but hardest to find scheme.
*   **The Deal**: You buy a specific "First Home" new build at a **30% to 50% discount** off market value.
*   **The Catch**: The discount stays with the property. When you sell, you must sell it to another First Time Buyer at the same discount. You never realize the full value.
*   **Eligibility**: Local connection (lived/work in area) or Key Worker. Income <£80k (<£90k London).

## 3. Shared Ownership (The "Stepping Stone")
You buy a share (e.g., 25%) and rent the rest from a Housing Association.
*   **Pros**: You only need a 5% deposit on *your share*. (e.g., 25% of £300k = £75k. 5% deposit = £3,750). It gets you through the door.
*   **Cons**: You pay rent + mortgage + service charge. Service charges can be uncapped and expensive.
*   **The 2025 Change**: You can now buy extra shares in 1% increments (used to be 10% min), making it easier to slowly own the whole thing.

## FAQ: First Time Buyers

### What happened to Help to Buy (Equity Loan)?
It ended in 2023 (England). Wales continues a version. In England, it has been effectively replaced by "Deposit Unlock" (commercial scheme) and First Homes.

### Should I wait for house prices to crash?
People have been waiting for a crash since 2005. While prices might wobble, a "Crash" (20% drop) usually means the economy has tanked and banks stop lending. Don't time the market; buy when *you* are financially ready.

### Can I use a LISA if I'm buying with someone who isn't a first-time buyer?
**Yes.** You can use your LISA and get the bonus. They just can't use one.

### How much deposit do I really need?
Technically 5%. But 5% mortgages have high interest rates. Aim for **10%**. The rate drops significantly at 10% LTV (Loan to Value), saving you hundreds a month.

## Conclusion

The days of 100% mortgages are gone. The game in 2025 is aggregating marginal gains: £2,000 from LISAs, Stamp Duty relief (First Time Buyers pay £0 on first £425k), and using family blockers (Guarantor mortgages) if needed.
