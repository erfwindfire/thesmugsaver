# Cost of Living Payment 2025: How to Claim Your £500 DWP Support in September

### Key Points
*   **The Support**: A targeted £500 payment for 8.2 million households on means-tested benefits.
*   **Eligibility**: You must be receiving Universal Credit, Pension Credit, or Tax Credits during the qualifying window.
*   **Qualifying Date**: You must have an active claim on **26 September 2025**.
*   **Action**: Payments are automatic. Beware of scams asking you to "apply".

As the winter of 2025 approaches, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has confirmed a new tranche of support to shelter the most vulnerable from energy costs.

This is a one-off tax-free payment of £500.

Unlike previous rounds, the criteria have tightened slightly. It is critical to ensure your benefits claim is active and error-free before the deadline.

## Who is Eligible? (The Criteria)

You will qualify if you receive any of the following:
*   Universal Credit
*   Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
*   Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
*   Income Support
*   Pension Credit
*   Child Tax Credit
*   Working Tax Credit

**Crucual Rule**: You must be entitled to a payment (of at least 1p) for an assessment period ending between **26 August 2025 and 25 September 2025**.

## The "Nil Award" Trap

If your Universal Credit payment for that specific month is **£0** (because your earnings were too high that month), you will **NOT** get the £600 Cost of Living payment.

*   **Strategy**: If you can, try to avoid a "double payday" or massive overtime payment falling exactly in that assessment window if it risks zeroing your Universal Credit.

## When Will I Be Paid?

*   **DWP Benefits**: Between **30 September 2025 and 13 October 2025**.
*   **Tax Credits only**: Between **6 October 2025 and 20 October 2025**.

The reference on your bank statement will be your NI Number followed by "DWP COL".

## Pension Credit: The "Backdoor" Route

This is massive. There are 800,000 pensioners entitled to Pension Credit who do not claim it.
*   **The Hack**: Pension Credit claims can be backdated by 3 months.
*   **The Opportunity**: If you apply for Pension Credit in **December 2025**, you can ask for it to be backdated to September. This would retroactively make you eligible for the £500 Cost of Living payment.
*   **Check Now**: If you are over State Pension age and have income <£218/week (single), check eligibility immediately.

## FAQ: DWP Payments

### Do I need to apply?
**NO.** It is automatic. Any email/text asking you to "click here to claim" is a scam.

### Does it count as income for tax?
No. It is tax-free and does not affect the Benefit Cap.

### I didn't get it but I'm eligible. What do I do?
Wait until **21 October 2025**. Then report a missing payment on the GOV.UK website.

## Conclusion

For 8 million households, this £500 is a vital lifeline. Ensure your claims are up to date and check on elderly relatives to see if they should be claiming Pension Credit to trigger this bonus.
