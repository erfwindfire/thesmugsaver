# Flexible Budgets for Irregular Income: UK Guide for Freelancers & Commission Earners (2025)

### Key Points
*   **The Problem**: Standard "Monthly" budgets fail when you get paid £5k in Jan and £0 in Feb.
*   **The Solution**: The "Holding Company" personal model. All income goes to a separate account; you pay yourself a fixed "salary" to your spending account.
*   **Tax Discipline**: The "Rule of 30". Instantly move 30% of every invoice to a Tax Pot. Never touch it.
*   **The Buffer**: You need a 3-6 month emergency fund, not the standard 3.

If you are one of the UK's 4.3 million self-employed, freelancers, or zero-hour contract workers, standard financial advice ("Set up a standing order on the 1st") is useless.

Your life is a sine wave of feast and famine. When the money comes in, you feel rich. When the invoices are late, you feel poor.

To survive 2025 without ulcers, you need to decouple your **Income** (volatile) from your **Spending** (fixed).

## The Strategy: The "Personal Salary" Method

Stop spending money as it hits your account.
1.  **Account A: The Business/Income Hub**
    *   All invoices/pay gets paid here.
2.  **Account B: The Tax Pot**
    *   30% of everything in A moves here instantly.
3.  **Account C: The Personal Current Account**
    *   You set up a Standing Order from A to C for a fixed amount (e.g., £2,500) on the 1st of the month.
4.  **Account D: The Reserve**
    *   Any surplus in A after the salary payment stays there. This builds up during "Feast" months to cover "Famine" months.

**Result**: Your personal life (Account C) looks boring and stable. Your bills get paid on time. The volatility is contained in Account A.

## The "Hill and Valley" Fund

You need a bigger buffer than employees.
*   **Target**: Calculate your "Minimum Viable Life" cost (Rent + Food + Bills). Multiply by 3. This is your floor.
*   **Rule**: If Account A drops below this level, you go into austerity mode.

## Tax: The Silent Killer of Freelancers

In the UK, "Payments on Account" catch people out. In January, you pay:
1.  Balancing payment for last year.
2.  50% of *estimated* tax for next year.
It acts as a double hit.
*   **Discipline**: Monzo/Starling "Business" accounts have "Tax Pots" that auto-slice a percentage of incoming payments. Turn this on. Set it to 30%. If you earn under £50k, 25% might suffice, but 30% is safe.

## FAQ: Irregular Income

### What if I have a bad month and can't pay my "Salary"?
This is what the Reserve (Account D) is for. If the Reserve is empty, *then* you lower your salary and cut personal spending.

### How do I get a mortgage?
Lenders look at "SA302" forms (Tax Calculations) for the last 2-3 years. They average your profit.
*   **Tip**: Do not aggressively minimize your profit (expenses) just to save tax if you plan to buy a house. Low profit = Low mortgage offer.

### Should I be a Sole Trader or Limited Company in 2025?
Corporation Tax is higher (19-25%), and Dividend Allowance is slashed (£500). For many earning <£60k, the admin of a Ltd Company is no longer worth the tax saving. Consult an accountant, but "Sole Trader" is making a comeback for simplicity.

## Conclusion

Stability is an illusion you create with structure. By acting as your own "Employer"—holding the cash and paying a fixed wage—you smooth out the anxiety of freelance life.
