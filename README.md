## Generating lib/articles.ts from processed-articles.txt

The `lib/articles.ts` file is auto-generated from a source text file. **Do not edit it manually.**

### Steps:

1. Download `processed-articles.txt` from the Claude conversation (the file generated by the article processing pipeline)
2. Place it in the **project root** (same level as `package.json`)
3. In Antigravity terminal (or local terminal), run:

```bash
node scripts/generate-articles.mjs
```

4. This creates `lib/articles.ts` with all 46 articles, correct categories, meta titles, meta descriptions, and word counts
5. Verify output: `grep -c 'slug:' lib/articles.ts` should return 46
6. Delete `processed-articles.txt` from the project root before committing (it's large and not needed in the repo)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Development server
npm run build      # Static build → /out directory
```

## Deployment

The repo is connected to Netlify. Every push to `main` triggers a rebuild.

Build command: `npm run build`  
Publish directory: `out`

## Pushing from Antigravity to GitHub

If the project is standalone in Antigravity, run these commands in the Antigravity terminal:

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "initial build from antigravity"
git remote add origin https://github.com/erfwindfire/thesmugsaver.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Note: if a `main` branch already exists (from this README commit), use:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```
